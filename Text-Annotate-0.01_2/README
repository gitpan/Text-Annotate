NAME
    Text::Annotate - add footnotes to content based on keyphrases used

SYNOPSIS
       synopsis not ready.

DESCRIPTION
    This system looks for key phrases within a document, for phrases which
    it knows about. If a document contains "hemiramphus far", it will
    provide a brief summary of whan a heriramphus is, and a link to find
    more out about it. Text::Annotate::DataSource handles the list of key
    phrases and the source of summary information.

    The Text::Annotate::KwikiTemplate module is intended to provide a
    "drop-in" extension which adds annotation to CGI::Kwiki software.

    This is very much alpha code. Please use appropriate caution.
